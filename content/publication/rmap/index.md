abstract: "The recent re-emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has exacerbated their threat to worldwide public health. The evolution of the genomics era has led to the generation of huge volumes of sequencing data at an unprecedented rate due to the ever-reducing costs of whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We have developed the Rapid Microbial Analysis Pipeline (rMAP), a user-friendly pipeline capable of profiling the resistomes of ESKAPE pathogens ( Enterococcus faecium , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Acinetobacter baumannii , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species) using WGS data generated from Illuminaâ€™s sequencing platforms. rMAP is designed for individuals with little bioinformatics expertise, and automates the steps required for WGS analysis directly from the raw genomic sequence data, including adapter and low-quality sequence read trimming, de novo genome assembly, genome annotation, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant calling, phylogenetic inference by maximum likelihood, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling, plasmid profiling, virulence factor determination, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), pangenome analysis and insertion sequence characterization (IS). Once the analysis is finished, rMAP generates an interactive web-like html report. rMAP installation is very simple, it can be run using very simple commands. It represents a rapid and easy way to perform comprehensive bacterial WGS analysis using a personal laptop in low-income settings where high-performance computing infrastructure is limited."
