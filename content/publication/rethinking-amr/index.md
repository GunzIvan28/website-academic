abstract: "Background: Antimicrobial resistance threatens the achievements of modern medicine as well as the sustainability of effective global public health responses to the threat posed by infectious diseases. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase production in bacteria provides the main mechanism of resistance in gram-negative bacteria, particularly those belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family as well as gram- positive bacteria. This study hence aimed at providing insights into the potential role of in-patients, their immediate hospital environments, out-patients, and their communities in the transmission of antimicrobial resistance via identifying gram-negative and gram- positive bacteria commonly isolated in samples collected from each of these patients/sites as well as their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles using extended-spectrum β-lactamase production in the same as the basis.
Methods: Our study reviewed four cross-sectional studies conducted at national and regional referral hospitals in Uganda. Data on bacterial aetiology and antimicrobial susceptibility testing retrieved from the studies was imported into Microsoft Excel, cleaned, sand then exported to IBM SPSS statistics (version 16) for statistical analysis. The databases used were PubMed and Embase.
Results: We report that; Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the most prevalent Enterobacteriaceae species in the samples that were collected in the studies reviewed; these species account for the highest proportions of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers; Staphylococcus aureus is the most prevalent of the gram-positive bacteria isolated from the same samples, and accounts for the highest proportions of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers in the gram-positive bacteria isolated, and similar Enterobacteriaceae species and gram-positive bacteria, are predominant in samples from in-patients, their immediate hospital environments, and out-patients. Conclusion: The insights provided indicate antimicrobial resistance transmission dynamics be re-thought and more comprehensive studies aimed at investigating the same be done to ascertain the source and transmission routes of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in clinical settings."
