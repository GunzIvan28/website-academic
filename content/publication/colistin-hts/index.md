abstract: "Bacterial infections involving antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria continue to increase and represent a major global public health concern. Resistance to antibiotics in these bacteria is mediated by chromosomal and/or acquired resistance mechanisms, these give rise to multi-drug resistant (MDR), extensive-drug resistant (XDR) or pan-drug resistant (PDR) bacterial strains. Most recently, plasmid-mediated resistance to colistin, an antibiotic that had been set apart as the last resort antibiotic in the treatment of infections involving MDR, XDR and PDR gram-negative bacteria has been reported. Plasmid-mediated colistin resistant gram-negative bacteria have been described to be PDR, implying a state devoid of alternative antibiotic therapeutic options. This review concisely describes the evolution of antibiotic resistance to plasmid-mediated colistin resistance and discusses the potential role of high-throughput sequencing technologies, genomics, and bioinformatics towards improving antibiotic resistance surveillance, the search for novel drug targets and precision antibiotic therapy focused at combating colistin resistance, and antibiotic resistance as a whole."
