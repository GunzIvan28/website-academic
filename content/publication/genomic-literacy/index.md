abstract: "Background: In Africa, health practitioners and the current knowledge of the pub-lic on genetics and genomics is still very low and yet this has potential to reduce the burden of common genetic diseases. Many initiatives have promoted genomic research, infrastructure, and capacity building in Africa. What remains to be done is to improve genomics literacy among populations and communities while utilizing an array of strategies. Genomic literacy and awareness are key in the management of genetic diseases which includes diagnosis, prevention of complications and therapy. Africa is characterized by great cultural and language diversity thereby requiring a multidisciplinary approach to improving public and community genomics literacy and engagement. However, this is further complicated by having the fact that sub‐Saharan Africa is comprised of countries with the lowest literacy rates in the world.Methods:  We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines to review genomic literacy in Africa using PubMed database.Results: We found very limited evidence of genomics literacy for genetic diseases in Africa.Conclusion: We propose a number of approaches that if adopted will significantly increase the genomic literacy and reduce the burden of genetic diseases in Africa."
